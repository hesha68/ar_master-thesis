Project Title:  Implementation Of A Head-Mounted Display Based On Augmented Reality For Harvester 
Keywords
Head mounted display, Augmented reality, Bucking data, GUI interface design, hydraulic, Geographical Information System.
Background
Swedish forestry has increased productions to stay competitive worldwide recently. It is essential to make working environment more organized and automated for operators to work efficiently. Head-Mounted Display (HMD) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications have been used widely in military but not yet implemented in the forestry industry. However, harvester operators can benefit from using AR based glasses to handle the process of cut-to-length, thinning, felling. So that there will be less contamination to the water and soil. 
Problem statement
Different assortments of tree and different diameters can be recognized by certain models built by the computer. In modern machines display that connected to the harvesters, the fed length of the tree and diameter of the tree are two dominating parameters. Some other parameters, such as tree species, bucked length, assortment and quality are also shown to ease the planning of sorting the trees. Further more, machine data, such as fuel level, engine temperature, hydraulic temperature and settings for the gear and boom speed are also required to shown to operators.
The GIS software and positioning software allow operators to follow the suggested roads and routing on the map in a satellite view together with the track where itself has traveled. Those facts and parameters have to included in the HMD implementation. 
Problem
Bucking tree data and machine data are complex sometimes and current Head Down Displays (HDD) do not offer an effective visualize way for operators to work with. Information can be presented using a HMD in a more immersive and intuitive way in both simulation and working environment. 
Purpose 
Developing an AR based system HMD by adding virtual contents to the predominantly real environment in forestry harvesting. So the context sensitive information can be presented in three dimensions.
Goal(s) 
The forestry can use this type of product to display all important information in a more direct way: fed length, bucked length, current diameter, assortment, machine data. The glasses will be able to do head tracking, obtaining GPS signal with high accuracy depth to water map display, and felling route display. Push messages such as error for engines and machine faults should also be displayed to alert the operators.
Tasks
Study the current HMD in the market. Finding practical issues and a suitable HMD for a short field test on displaying bucking data. The test should involves user experience and ocular inspection.
Develop high luminosity display coupled with combiner .
Develop light weight guiding optics, achieve a resolution of 2arcmin/pixel.
Developing head tracking technology with inertial sensors, cameras installed in the cabin.
Develop a condensed version of the HDD based on existed information in the display with the help from machine control system itself. 
Harvester bucking data GUI Interface design and test with operators instead of HDD to compare it with the developed HMD technology. Adjust GUI to improve the results.

Risks, Consequences and Ethics
Risk
Plans have to be changed according to the company’s expectations.
Ordered components are not delivered on time or faulty.
Loss access to license of embedded software
Lack of certain knowledge, such as interface design.
Do not know machine control knowledge.
It will be information security issues with AR glasses when it will be easier to access public data. So personal privacy will be invaded. The more we rely on this system, the more could be go wrong in the future. Also it will lead to authentication problem when someone else could access forestry data easily and hack the system when AR helps system more integrated.
Summary
With the AR concept, virtual components will be added directly on real environment in forestry to help operators to bucking data and handling machine error messages. With more detailed and deeper research on this area, applications of this tool will be put in the industrial in the future. Assortment and species will be displayed, diameter and fed length are presented as well as significant information. This implemented AR will embed head tracking technology and help machine to navigate how to process with harvesting.
